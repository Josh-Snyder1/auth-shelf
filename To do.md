    []  The Shelf page (`ShelfPage.js`at `/shelf`) should show all of the items stored in the database in a list or table.
[]  ADD
    []  The Shelf page (`ShelfPage.js` at `/shelf`) should allow a user to add a new item to the database (which should immediately appear in the list).> NOTE: Image url should be a full path to an existing image on the web. You should not attempt to implement image upload for this.
[]  DELETE
    [] An authenticated user should be able to delete items from the shelf if they were the one who added the item to the shelf.> NOTE: This should require client and server changes. An unauthenticated attacker from Postman should not be able to delete anything.
